# Denki Block Tool

As part of some programming practice, I decided to try and make a recreation of the popular GBA game, Denki Blocks, entirely within Java. While not developed much, blocks can move in clumps like in the final game, and get blocked by wall blocks, as well as blocks of the opposite colour.

This project was created within Eclipse. To test this code out for yourself, clone this repo into a desired folder of yours. Then, import the repo into your Eclipse workspace, via *Import...*, then *General > Existing Projects into Workspace*. From there, you should be able to run the program like any other Eclipse project.

Additionally, you can import directly from the Git clone URI within Eclipse. Right clicking on your Eclipse Project Explorer, navigating to *Import...*, then navigating to *Git > Projects from Git*, you can follow the wizard to clone this project for your own perview.
